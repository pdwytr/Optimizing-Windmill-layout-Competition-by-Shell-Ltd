    "\n",
    "        This is vectorzied version of Farm_Evalautor.py. \n",
    "        Farm_Evalautor_Vec.py is a python file that calculates AEP (GWh)\n",
    "        of a certain arrangement of wind turbines in a farm, under \n",
    "        given annual wind conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "        The code in this script for wake-effect modeling is based on\n",
    "        standard Jensen (PARK) model. \n",
    "        I. Katic, J. Hojstrup and N. Jensen, \"A simple model for cluster \n",

    "        Exhibition, 1986.\n",

    "        As its inputs, the code takes three data files containing info \n",

    "    PACKAGE LIST\n",
    "        You may need to install the package Shapely in your\n",

    "    OPTIMIZATION USAGE\n",
    "        This vectorized version is faster than unvectorized version\n",
    "        Farm_Evalautor.py. Due to speed benefits, we advise you to use \n",
    "        the function getAEP in this script while developing the optimizer. \n",
    "        =============================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "        One way to use getAEP function as AEP evaluator while optimizing is:\n",
    "        - STEP 1. Import the relevant function from Farm_Evalautor_Vec. \n",
    "                  from Farm_Evalautor_Vec import getTurbLoc, loadPowerCurve, \n",
    "                  binWindResourceData, preProcessing, getAEP\n",
    "        - STEP 2. Set Turbine Radius to 50.0. First arg of getAEP\n",
    "        - STEP 3. Load Turbine Locations. Using function getTurbLoc\n",
    "        - STEP 4. Load Power Curve. Using function loadPowerCurve\n",
    "        - STEP 5. Load wind instance probabilities. \n",
    "                  Using function binWindResourceData\n",
    "        - STEP 6. Perform Preprocessing by calling function preProcessing.\n",
    "                  We do preprocessing to avoid same repeating calculations.\n",
    "                  Do them once. \n",
    "        - STEP 7. Finally, call function getAEP\n",
    "\n",
    "        This makes it easy to control the reloading of data and hence achieve\n",
