#1. Approach

Genetic Algorithms approach is used to  maximize the totalAEP of the layout

->Chromosome: Randomly generated 50 points layout satisfying perimeter and proximity constraints
->Fitness Function: Function to improve TotalAEP of the farm
->New population generation : Crossover of top layouts or Mutation
->Selection: it is based on Highest Total Aep layouts from elite population

#2.Algorithm Engineering

->initial population: previous top performing layouts or random layouts if not available
->Crossover: Select 50 points from randomly from the parent layouts
->Mutation: Select portion of edge points plus randomly selecting remaining of the 50 points satisfying constraints
->Velocity-Direction Profile: Weighted averages previously available 3 years of Velocity-Direction data

#3. Tools used

->Google colabs
->Jupyter notebooks
